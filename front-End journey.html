        <h1>Why I Want to Be a Front-End Developer and How HNG Will Help Me Achieve My Goals</h1>

        <h2>Why I Want to Be a Front-End Developer</h2>
        <p>Ever since I started using the internet, I’ve been fascinated by the websites I visited. What really intrigued me was how websites were designed to be functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly. As I explored further, I realized that there was a world behind the scenes that made these websites possible. That’s when I started learning about web development, and it instantly clicked—this is the field I wanted to pursue.</p>

        <p>Front-end development, in particular, combines my love for creativity and problem-solving. The idea of creating something that people can interact with, solve problems through, and enjoy using excites me. I love the challenge of making websites not just look great but also function seamlessly on various devices. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which opened my eyes to the art and science of web development.</p>

        <p>What really draws me to front-end development is the constant innovation in the field. New frameworks, libraries, and tools are continuously introduced, offering endless opportunities for growth.
